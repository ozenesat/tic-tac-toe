# Esat's Tic Tac Toe Game Project

In this first project I have ever developed by myself, I developped a single page(spa) application website for 'the tic tac toe' game. Tic tac toe is a generic game for two players. In my website two people can play together as Player X and Player O. Only the registered user is allowed to play the game. As soon as this user signed in, s/he can see the previous games and total games played as well.

## Technologies
In this project, I used jQuery, AJAX, bootStrap with JavaScript, HTML and CSS technologies.

## Development
I started my project with my basic HTML page with bootStrap. Firstly I created a gameboard. And then I started to work on game code logic at the events page. After developing a perfectly working game on the gameboard in my basic index.html page, I added a user sign-up/sign-in feature on my eventsUser page. Then I added create game, update game, get previous games, and game stats features with the signed-in user with game ids. I used jQuery and AJAX technologies on these pages. Then I finalized my index.html page and did some makeups on it on index.scss. In each step, I always checked the game with some user stories and fixed the errors/bugs instantly.

## Wireframe and User Stories
Even if I updated my wireframe progressively with the new functions of the page, here is my very first (on this project and my life) wireframe is here:

And my game stories are here:
- As a new user, I should sign up so that I can sign-in and play the game.
- As a returning user, I should sign in so that I can start a new game.
- As a apprehensive user, I should sign in so that I can change my password.
- As a statistician user, I should have statics option so that I can learn how many games I played.
- As a leave nothing to chance user, I should sign out so that no one can not start a new game with my account.
## Planning Updates

 I am working on allowing users to keep playing on their previous unfinished games. Then I am planning to add automatic sign-in feature after sign-up, and upgrading the game's multiplayer version, and against the computer version for the single players.
